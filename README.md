# Buzzo

Buzzo is a DIY open source set of game show buttons.

# Parts Required

## Buzzo Button 
The Buzzo Button is the device that each player holds. A Buzzo set should have at least two buttons

A single button requires...
- 1x Assembled Buzzo LED ring PCB
- 1x Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather dev board (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5477)
- 1x 9mm Piezeo Buzzer (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0827DS4HH)
- 1x 500mAh Lithium Ion Battery (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578)
- 1x 10mm (tall) x 12mm x 12mm tactile switch (https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/C127505.html)
- 7x M2x10mm screw
- Wire
- 3D printed parts (PLA for the main body, White TPU for the button cap)

## Buzzo Controller
The Buzzo Controller is the device that manages everything. A working Buzzo set needs to have one of these.

A controller requires...
- 1x Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather dev board (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5477)
- 1x 500mAh Lithium Ion Battery (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578)
- 1x 3mm LED
- 1x Resistor, (value depending on the LED forward voltage)
- 4x tactile sitch *See note below*
- 4x M2x10mm screw
- Wire
- 3D printed parts (PLA for the main body, White TPU for the button caps)

*Note*
This project is a work in progress, and I never designed an actual PCB for the Buzzo controller. It needs to have four buttons, but this side quest you'll need to undertake.
